## **1. Introduction**

This project demonstrates an end-to-end Azure Data Engineering pipeline that ingests, transforms, stores, and visualizes data using multiple Azure services. It covers two core areas:
1.	**Data Engineering** – Building a complete pipeline from the data source to Azure Synapse.
2.	**Data Analytics** – Writing SQL queries to extract insights and visualizing them through a Power BI dashboard.

## **2. Objective**

The objective of this project is to develop a complete data pipeline using various technologies such as GitHub, Azure Data Factory, Azure Data Lake Storage, Azure Databricks, Azure Synapse Analytics, and Power BI. The goal is to demonstrate a seamless integration of tools and services to provide a full data solution—from ingestion to analytics.

## 3. Data Used

The dataset used in this project is based on the Tokyo Olympics 2021. It includes the following five CSV files stored on GitHub:
•	**Athletes**
•	**Coaches**
•	**Entries by Gender**
•	**Medals**
•	**Teams**

**Source:** Kaggle - Tokyo Olympics 2021 Dataset
This dataset contains information on over 11,000 athletes, 47 disciplines, and 743 teams. It includes athlete names, their disciplines, gender, country, and coach details.
