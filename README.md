## 1. Introduction

This project demonstrates an end-to-end Azure Data Engineering pipeline that ingests, transforms, stores, and visualizes data using multiple Azure services. It covers two core areas:
1.	Data Engineering – Building a complete pipeline from the data source to Azure Synapse.
2.	Data Analytics – Writing SQL queries to extract insights and visualizing them through a Power BI dashboard.
